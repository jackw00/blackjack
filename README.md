Added functionality: 
Dealer who receives cards.
Rules page.
Ability to win/lose based on the dealers hand.
"Random" generation is like a standard 52 card deck - used until run out of cards, then reshuffled/refilled. 
Stylistic changes.
Ability to wager with each hand based on knowing first card.
A total balance that updates based on each hand/wager.
A new game button that allows you to restart and change your name and starting total balance.
